# Minesweeper with React and Redux

🕹️ [Play it here](https://sldias.github.io/minesweeper)

## How to play

The login page is front-end only, you can use the following credentials to log in or use whatever username and password you prefer and then click on Register:

```
user: admin
password: password
```

Users are only used to keep track of wins and losses and it will only keep the data while the tab is open. \
You can try registering different users and logging in and out to see it in action.

## Motivation

I did this after learning about [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) a few years ago (check commit history). \
At that time, I had already written some React code but mostly to add features or bugfixes to existing projects,
so I did not had the experience of setting up a React app from zero and I figured it was a good opportunity to do so. \
Why a minesweeper game? because it is a very reactive thing, meaning that it is the problem that React is suppose to solve 
and I enviosined it playing nicely with Redux's approach (IMO, it did turn out great). \
Also because I thought that coming up with the logic behind a minesweeper game would be fun to implement. :)

## References

This was **done with no specific tutorial** for this application and, to understand Redux, I mostly read it's docs and [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/redux-react-guide/#redux-toolkit) which writes a "posts" type of app but explains redux's concepts really well.
