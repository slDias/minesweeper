# Minesweeper with React and Redux

🕹️ [Play it here](https://sldias.github.io/minesweeper)

## Motivation

I did this after learning about [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
At that time, I've already written some React code but mostly to add features or bugfixes to existing projects
so I did not had the experience of setting up a react app from the start before this.

## References

This was **done with no specific tutorial** for this application and, to understand Redux, I mostly read it's docs and [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/redux-react-guide/#redux-toolkit) which writes a "posts" type of app but explains redux's concepts really well.
